The {gtreg} package creates tabular data summaries appropriate for regulatory submissions.
The package builds the tables using {gtsummary}.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {gtreg} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shannonpileggi/gtreg")
```

## Example

Summarize Adverse Events by Grade.
The denominators in the table are the number of patients in the study.

```{r example}
library(gtreg)
gtsummary::theme_gtsummary_compact()

tbl_ae <- 
  df_adverse_events %>%
  tbl_ae(
    id_df = df_patient_characteristics,
    id = patient_id,
    ae = adverse_event,
    soc = system_organ_class, 
    by = grade, 
    strata = trt
  ) %>%
  modify_ae_header(all_ae_cols() ~ "**Grade {by}**") %>% 
  bold_labels()
```

```{r example-tbl_ae, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl_ae), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
# Have to do this workaround since the README needs markdown format for GitHub page but a different format for the website.
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  as_gt(tbl)
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example-tbl_ae-1.png")
} 
```

Summarize Raw Adverse Counts

```{r example2}
tbl_ae_count <- 
  df_adverse_events %>%
  tbl_ae_count(
    ae = adverse_event,
    soc = system_organ_class, 
    by = drug_attribution
  ) %>%
  add_overall(across = "by") %>%
  modify_ae_spanning_header(all_ae_cols() ~ "**Drug Attribution**") %>%
  bold_labels()
```

```{r example-tbl_ae_count, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl_ae_count), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp2.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "76%", echo = FALSE}
# Have to do this workaround since the README needs markdown format for GitHub page but a different format for the website.
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  as_gt(tbl)
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example-tbl_ae_count-1.png")
} 
```

Focus on rates of high grade complications with `tbl_ae_focus()`

```{r example3}
tbl_ae_focus <- 
  df_adverse_events %>%
  tbl_ae_focus(
    id_df = df_patient_characteristics,
    id = patient_id,
    ae = adverse_event,
    include = c(any_complication, grade3_complication)
  )
```

```{r example-tbl_ae_focus, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl_ae_focus), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp3.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "62%", echo = FALSE}
# Have to do this workaround since the README needs markdown format for GitHub page but a different format for the website.
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  as_gt(tbl)
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example-tbl_ae_focus-1.png")
} 
```
