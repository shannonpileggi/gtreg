The {gtreg} package creates tabular data summaries appropriate for regulatory submissions.
The package builds the tables using {gtsummary}.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {gtreg} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shannonpileggi/gtreg")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(gtreg)
gtsummary::theme_gtsummary_compact()

tbl <- 
  df_adverse_events %>%
  tbl_ae(
    id = patient_id,
    ae = adverse_event,
    soc = system_organ_class, 
    by = grade, 
    strata = trt,
    header = "**Grade {level}**"
  ) %>%
  bold_labels()
```

```{r example-tbl_adverse_event, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
# Have to do this workaround since the README needs markdown format for GitHub page but a different format for the website.
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  as_gt(tbl)
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example-tbl_adverse_event-1.png")
} 
```
