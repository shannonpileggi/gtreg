\usage{
tbl_ae_focus(
  data,
  include,
  id,
  ae,
  soc = NULL,
  strata = NULL,
  id_df = NULL,
  statistic = "{n} ({p})",
  label = NULL,
  header_strata = NULL,
  zero_symbol = "â€”",
  digits = NULL,
  sort = c("alphanumeric", "frequency")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame}

\item{include}{Vector of column names to summarize. Column names may be
quoted or unquoted. All columns must be class 'logical'.}

\item{id}{Variable name of the patient ID}

\item{ae}{Variable name of the adverse event column}

\item{soc}{Variable name of the system organ class column}

\item{strata}{Variable to stratify results by, e.g. report AEs summaries
by treatment group}

\item{id_df}{Optional data frame of complete id values and strata to achieve correct
base n for the situation in which not all subjects experience adverse events}

\item{statistic}{String indicating the statistics that will be reported.
The default is \code{"{n} ({p})"}}

\item{label}{A named list of labels that will be applied in the
resulting table. Names must be those passed in \verb{include=}. Default is
NULL, and either the label attribute or the column name will be used.}

\item{header_strata}{String indicating the strata header to be placed in the table.
Default is \code{"**{level}**, N = {n}"} and only used when \verb{strata=} is specified.}

\item{zero_symbol}{String used to represent cells with zero counts. Default
is the em-dash (\code{"\\U2014"}). Using \code{zero_symbol = NULL} will print the
zero count statistics, e.g. \code{"0 (0)"}}

\item{digits}{Specifies the number of decimal places to round the summary statistics.
By default integers are shown to zero decimal places, and percentages are
formatted with \code{style_percent()}. If you would like to modify either
of these, pass a vector of integers indicating the number of decimal
places to round the statistics. For example, if the statistic being
calculated is \code{"{n} ({p}\%)"} and you want the percent rounded to
2 decimal places use \code{digits = c(0, 2)}.
User may also pass a styling function: \code{digits = style_sigfig}}

\item{sort}{Controls order AEs appear.  When \code{ae} is specified without \code{soc},
applies to AEs overall.
When \code{ae} is specified with \code{soc}, applies to AEs within SOCs.  Default is
\code{"alphanumeric"} for alphabetical sorting. \code{sort = "frequency"} will
sort in decreasing frequency order.}

\description{
Summarize dichotomous AE data. For example, report the
rate of patients that have an AE of Grade 3 or higher.
