\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame}

\item{include}{Vector of column names to summarize. Column names may be
quoted or unquoted. All columns must be class 'logical'.}

\item{id}{Variable name of the patient ID}

\item{ae}{Variable name of the adverse event column}

\item{soc}{Variable name of the system organ class column}

\item{strata}{Variable to stratify results by, e.g. report AEs summaries
by treatment group}

\item{id_df}{Optional data frame of complete id values and strata to achieve correct
base n for the situation in which not all subjects experience adverse events}

\item{statistic}{String indicating the statistics that will be reported.
The default is \code{"{n} ({p})"}}

\item{label}{A named list of labels that will be applied in the
resulting table. Names must be those passed in \verb{include=}. Default is
NULL, and either the label attribute or the column name will be used.}
}
\value{
a 'tbl_ae_focus' object
}
\description{
Summarize AE data that is binary or dichotomous. For example, report the
rate of patients that have an AE of Grade 3 or higher.
